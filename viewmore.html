            <h4>Start With the Basics</h4>
            <p>
            First, you should decide where you will be starting seeds. Most homeowners
            don’t have a greenhouse, so a west-facing windowsill can be ideal, as can grow lights.
             In addition to your soil and container, you’ll need labels and a selection of seeds to get started.

            <h4>Selecting Your Seeds</h4>
            <p>
               Starting seeds from home can be a fairly simple process. 
               You’ll want to start seeds where you want to install a young plant into the flower or vegetable garden. 
               These would be vegetables like tomato, pepper, eggplant, basil, 
               etc., or flowers such as zinnia, marigold, cosmos, salvia, vinca, begonias, etc. 
               Many vegetables can be directly sown into the garden like carrots, beets, radishes, corn, cucumbers, squash, etc. 
               Early crops such as kale, broccoli, and Swiss chard need to be started much earlier in the season, so growing young plants from seed will allow the gardener to plant young plants outside early in the spring. 
               Many perennials can also be started from seed, such as coneflowers, hellebores, coreopsis, etc.

            <h4>Seed Starting Containers</h4>
            <p>
               There are many containers that can be used for starting seeds. 
               Cell packs are a consideration because they keep the individual seedlings separated. Small flats can also be used. 
               Small circular or square pots that are three to four inches wide with drain holes in the bottom are a good choice too. 
               Plastic containers, such as yogurt containers or milk jugs, can be retrofitted for use in growing seedlings. They need to be cleaned out thoroughly, and holes should be poked in the bottom so the soil freely drains. 
               Labeling each container with the date of seed sowing as well as the name of the plant will be helpful for record keeping.

            <h4>Selecting a Soil for Starting Seeds</h4>
            <p>
              Any selection of seed starting soil needs to be lightweight so that the seedlings can easily germinate. 
              It should also be sterile so it is free of potential pests and diseases. The soil should have some sort of organic matter that will make the soil retentive of moisture, but it also must be free draining. 
              Mixes sometimes have perlite in them which helps promote good drainage. Selecting an organic-based soil that does not have peat is a good environmentally-friendly approach.

              The depth at which the seeds should be planted is often outlined on the packet. 
              Very tiny seeds such as petunia seed can be lightly spread over the surface of the soil and only ever so lightly covered with additional soil.
              Other plants with large seeds like the Mexican sunflower, Tithonia, or the hyacinth bean, Lablab purpureus should have the seeds planted significantly below the soil surface.

            <h4>Conditions for Seed Germination</h4>
            <p>
              Most home gardeners do not have access to a greenhouse to provide ample light and humid conditions for seed germination. 
              These conditions can easily be replicated! A round or square plastic pot can be covered with a clear plastic bag and secured with a rubber band after watering the seedlings. 
              A plastic bag will help hold in moisture while keeping the emerging seedlings in a humid environment. Large bags or pieces of translucent plastic can be used for the same effect. 
              For large pots or planting trays, sometimes it is necessary to install sticks or dowels to keep the plastic propped above the soil surface.

            <h4>Growing Seedlings</h4>
            <p>
              Depending on the types of plants, germination will occur sometimes in less than seven days, or up to several weeks from the time you plant your seedlings. 
              It is important to try to adequately space the seeds when planting them, or the seedlings will germinate in crowded conditions. This is often harder to do with plants with fine seed and easier to do with plants with large seeds like marigolds and zinnias. 
              The first leaves to emerge are called the cotyledons. After the emergence of the cotyledons, true leaves which look like the actual leaves of the plant will start to emerge.

            <p>
              Once the seedlings are growing and established as healthy, young plants, they can then be planted in the garden. 
              For early spring crops, like kale and Brussels sprouts, planting should be done when the temperatures are conducive to planting; for summer crops and annuals, plant after the last frost-free date has passed.

                It’s that time of year again! Time to plant and get your seeds started. 
                Some may wait a bit in the northern hemisphere, but most of us are enjoying a relatively mild winter and early spring.  
                Hopefully it means a mild summer, but we’ll see. In the meantime here’s some gorgeous video timelapse footage of seeds germinating and sprouting forth from the soil. 
                It’s beautiful to watch.
